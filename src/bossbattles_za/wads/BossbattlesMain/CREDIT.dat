=====Other Creds=====

AS A SIDENOTE: I Can't take 100% for this wad, my idea was to get bosses from all other
games and mods. I did not create everything here, as more I just compiled other stuff
into one wad. Most of the credit goes to realm667 and other people for the work they 
submitted or helped with. without there help this mod wouldn't exist.

Credits: Id Software, monolith software, Zandronum, Raven Software, Skulltag, Zdaemon, Zdoom, Zdoom wiki, Action doom,  3d Realms, wrw and monster
resource wad, Midway, netherrealm studios, Vgmusic, Fathax Wadhost,
The people who remade doom 64 for pc, Everyone who put monsters up on Realm667 Beastiary and armory. 
midi music was borrowed from metal slug, Metroid, Dragon view, contra for ps2, doom 3,
and paper mario tyt, thanks to those artists and there great work on those music pieces. 
If I forget You, YES YOU! please tell me.
